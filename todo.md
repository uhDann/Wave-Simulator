Misha:

- Assumptions √
  I took all the assumptions that were in overleaf and wrote about the ones that made sense.
  The ones I didn't write about were:
  Phase, because I wrote about perfect signals in general.
  Isolated environment, because we do model environmental noise and I write separately about boundary condition validity.
  No reflection, because we ended up implementing reflection.
  2D/3D because there are no 3D effects in 2D. Maybe we can write about using 2D as a model for 3D in certain situations, but I think we can come back to this later.

- Description of Simulation Tools √
- TODO derivation reference
- Review sources explanation √
- Describe the process of implementing the model and running the simulations. √

Charlene:
\
- Finish up the Noise bit
- Do the Intro bits below
  - Check that we cover: Why is the model of the system you are developing needed/significant (what problems does it solve)?
  - We need at least 5 references, they have to talk about the existing approaches to modelling our system or phenomenon, maybe we need to add sources to Misha’s Theoretical bit.
 - Maybe a couple references for modelling source modelling, i.e. Gaussian packet for Dirac delta function.
- Check Results/Intro
  - Please make sure this links to the objectives and case studies outlined in Section 1
    - I think rather we need to explain in the introduction how what we are doing is relevant to the objectives and case studies.
- Theoretical background
  - Maybe add a block diagram or something more schematical.
      Misha's suggestion: Maybe a general diagram where we have like a simulation object and we have a bunch of sources and they all feed into the object and the output is a pressure field in 2D/3D. It will look very cool.
- Discussion and Conclusions


Danila 

- Finish up analysis of the E2 and E3 √
- Talk about the specific objectives, maybe incorporate our roadmap/plan √
- Theoretical Background:
  - Check that we hit all of the relevant mathematical topics √
- Clean up the code + check -> Make sure its in the submisson stage √
- Generate the UML Diagrams √
